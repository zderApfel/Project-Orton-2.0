# Project Orton 2.0

## Story

### Background

Takes place in a future where aggressive scientific advancement to attempt to quell the rising
climate has driven the Earth into a Second Ice Age. On top of the catastrophic destruction of 
a large portion of Earth's biomass, many of the world's nations could not sustain the ongoing
economic pressures from migration, inflation from destroyed supply chains, and warfare between
desperate leaders clinging to the few resources that remained

The United States was not immune from this fallout, completely collapsing during the 2143 fascist 
uprising that transformed the once separate but equal empire into a mess of neo-fuedal lords

In the context of this story, a majority of it will be taking place in the fictional region of
Marin county, Florida. The biggest city in this region, Orton City, led by the seemingly immortal
former 46th Governor of Florida, Royland DeSantos, became one of the last economic powerhouses 
of the world; fueled by both legal and illicit trades

Your character is an experienced hacker who was one of the main engineers behind the 
FreedomNet(tm). The FreedomNet was the new Internet that replaced the former when the Ice
Age destroyed most major infrastructure to sustain it. You also have deep criminal contacts, 
as you also used your inside knowledge to jailbreak the FreedomNet, creating the actually free
l0lznet, which boasts high resistance to government overreach and surveilance, enabling the 
distribution of illicit products, services, and ideas

The game's story as it's written here will be split into chapters to track major story progress 
when actually getting to designing the game. Most chapters will allow further access to certain game
world and gameplay elements either at the start or on their completion

### Prologue

You are currently serving a 30 year prison sentence at the infamous Orton M4X for creating 
the popular jailbroken FreedomNet, l0lznet. For you, creating the FreedomNet was just a means 
to an end. Deep down you despise the world you were born into, the government that DeSantos 
leads, and the man himself, for his crimes against humanity that both you and people close to you
have endured. Creating the l0lznet was your biggest act of spite, to betray the trust given to you 
by the man you loathe oh so deeply

However, it's not over for you. Some of your contacts from the outside need your skills, and thus,
a breakout is in order. The Prologue will serve as a gameplay tutorial, and can be skipped
on creating a file or going to new game plus, if so desired
