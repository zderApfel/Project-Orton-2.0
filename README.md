# Project Orton 2.0

# Story

## Background

Takes place in a future where aggressive scientific advancement to attempt to quell the rising
climate has driven the Earth into a Second Ice Age. On top of the catastrophic destruction of 
a large portion of Earth's biomass, many of the world's nations could not sustain the ongoing
economic pressures from migration, inflation from destroyed supply chains, and warfare between
desperate leaders clinging to the few resources that remained

The United States was not immune from this fallout, completely collapsing during the 2143 fascist 
uprising that transformed the once separate but equal empire into a mess of neo-fuedal lords

In the context of this story, a majority of it will be taking place in the fictional region of
Marin county, Florida. The biggest city in this region, Orton City, led by the seemingly immortal
former 46th Governor of Florida, Royland DeSantos, became one of the last economic powerhouses 
of the world; fueled by both legal and illicit trades

Your character is an experienced hacker who was one of the main engineers behind the 
FreedomNet(tm). The FreedomNet was the new Internet that replaced the former when the Ice
Age destroyed most major infrastructure to sustain it. You also have deep criminal contacts in 
Blackguard, as you also used your inside knowledge to jailbreak the FreedomNet, 
creating the actually free l0lznet, which boasts high resistance to government overreach and 
surveilance, enabling the distribution of illicit products, services, and ideas

**The game's story as it's written here will be split into chapters to track major story progress 
when actually getting to designing the game. Most chapters will allow further access to certain game
world and gameplay elements either at the start or on their completion**

**Each chapter will have tasks that need to be completed in order to be considered complete.
How the player decides to overcome these tasks will be put up to them, with different methods
of completion being presented to the player. Also, every chapter has optional tasks that can
have effects on the story**

**Depending on how the player decides to overcome their tasks, the county's chaos may increase.
More on chaos will be written in this document**

**Some chapters may have time limits to complete, timed by in game days**

## Prologue - Reprieve

You are currently serving a 30 year prison sentence at the infamous Orton M4X for creating 
the popular jailbroken FreedomNet, l0lznet. For you, creating the FreedomNet was just a means 
to an end. Deep down you despise the world you were born into, the government that DeSantos 
leads, and the man himself, for his crimes against humanity that both you and people close to you
have endured. Creating the l0lznet was your biggest act of spite, to betray the trust given to you 
by the man you loathe oh so deeply

However, it's not over for you. Some of your contacts from the outside need your skills, and thus,
a breakout is in order. 

**The Prologue will serve as a gameplay tutorial, and can be skipped
on creating a file or going to new game plus, if so desired**

**The prologue also does not have any optional objectives**

## Chapter 1 - Anathema

Turns out the rescue mission was transactional rather than a favor. Without being given a choice,
you are thrown out into the field once again by the Blackguard. 

The Blackguard leader, who goes by Chet, has tasked you with breaking into Orton City's Police
HQ to wipe out a portion of their criminal database after the organization betrayed Chet
by breaking a previous agreement to assist in the smuggling of weapons throughout the county

While you are completing the hack, you learn that some of the weapons Blackguard was smuggling
has been getting funneled to Old Fluskworks, a massive abandoned factory and former site
of Baron Flusk's production efforts. **You will be given a choice whether or not to relay this
information to Blackguard**

**OPTIONAL:** While invading the OCPD's HQ, you can learn that Detective Mongrelooso, the prick
that stabbed you in the back, getting you imprisoned years ago, is still working at the department
and is present during your operation. The player will be given the option to:

	- **Confront and kill him, or kill without being spotted:** This will have major story 
	consequences and greatly 

	- **Confront, but spare him:** This will NOT have story consequences, but slightly
	increase **chaos**

	- **Plant Evidence in his office**: This will have minor story consequence but NOT impact **chaos**
	
## Chapter 2 - Fervor

While completing the primary objective in Chapter 1, you discover information that the OCPD was 
funnelling Blackguard's smuggled weapons to Old Fluskworks, against Chet's agreement with them.
The player can choose whether or not to report this to Chet:
	
	- **Telling him** results in him demanding you go and investigate, he will provide you will
	provide you equipment to help with the possible dangers present
	- **Not telling him** results in your character will manifest the idea to investigate themselves. 
	Chet will inform you that he will be contacting you again in the future with more work

## Combat Classes and Abilities

The player can at any time up to three different "loadouts" that can be toggled much like an 
individual item would. Each loadout has two slots, resembling the player's hands. 
The player can equip two one-handed weapons in either hand, or one two-handed weapon

Depending on the weapon(s) equipped, your character will be assigned a [combat class]. Combat
classes each have a set of three abilities that can be selected ahead of time. These abilities 
grant additional options that synergize with the playstyle the weapon(s) will likely be used with, and either have a cooldown or a stamina cost
attatched. Additionally, every weapon class has a predetermined secondary action that doesn't 
usually have a cooldown or stamina cost

Weapon class abilities are unlocked as you level up your proficiency with different weapon 
classes

Combat Classes are determined by the weapon in the RIGHT hand. So a pistol in the left hand
but a melee in the right hand means the abilities are dictated by the melee weapon

## Weapon Types

* [Light Melee] - One-handed melee weapons. These can deal either slash, strike, or pierce
damage. All melee weapons have critical strike chance

	[Shield] - Shields are unique melee weapons that can use their own abilities as well as those
	for light melee weapons. Shields work uniquely from other weapons in that:
		
		* While held in the main hand, attack and block with their secondary action.
		
		* While in the off hand, ALWAYS block
		
		* Shield blocking has little to no chip damage and can be used to parry with good timing
		
* [Heavy Melee] - Two-handed melee weapons that tend to be slower but hit harder. These 
tend to deal strike damage but a few also deal slash damage

* [Pistol] - A one-handed firearm that's relatively weak on its own. Two pistols together become
the backbone for Gun Kata and there's little reason to use one pistol on one's own. Pistols use
10mm ammunition and have moderate critical strike chance when aiming

	* [Revolver] - A subclass of pistols that overall trade firing rate, ammo capacity and speed 
	for accuracy and power. Revolvers can utilize both pistol abilities and unique ones for 
	themself. Revolvers use .357 ammunition and have a moderate critical strike chance when aiming
	
* [Submachine Guns] - Two-handed firearms that can fire in full auto and with high rate of fire.
Accuracy is best suited for close quarters. SMGs use 10mm ammunition and have a low critical
strike chance when aiming

* [Assault Rifles] - Two-handed firearms that can fire in full auto and a moderate rate with
decent accuracy up to mid range. Uses 5.56 ammunition and have a low critical
strike chance when aiming

* [Shotguns] - Two-handed firearms that fire a spread of rounds in close quarters. Have both
pump-action and semi-automatic varieties. Shotguns use 12 guage rounds and cannot critical
strike

	* [Riot Shotguns] - A variant of shotguns that fire pepperballs instead of 12 guage rounds.
	These shotguns afflict minimal HP damage and are used to incapacitate rather than kill

* [Marksman Rifles] - Two-handed firearms that fire semi-automatic with good accuracy at mid to
long ranges. Uses 7.62 ammunition and have a high critical strike chance when aiming

* [Sniper Rifles] - Two-handed firearms that fire in bolt-action with pinpoint accuracy at very
long range. Uses .308 rounds and have a high critical strike chance when aiming

## Combat Classes

against any weapon that's not fists, except when parrying

other hand

strike chance, depending on the gun

with as well

increased pellet spread and recoil. Reduces stamina with every shot

* [Quick Load] pump shotgun, sniper; stamina - After firing a round, activate this ability 
at the right time to quickly load another shell into the breach of the shotgun

Targets hit by richochet bullets have a chance to suffer a critical hit

the magazine to reload your weapon instantly. If the magazine hits a foe, it deals a small
amount of poise damage with a chance to stagger

* [Hail of Lead] gun kata; stamina - Use your remaining ammo to fire a volley of rounds in an arc in front
of you. The frequency of fire while arcing is tied directly to remaining loaded ammunition

* [Hold Breath] marksman rifle, sniper rifle; stamina - Hold your breath while held, at the 
cost of stamina, which steadies your aim

* [Scout's Stim] submachine gun, marksman rifle, sniper rifle; cooldown - Inject yourself 
with a stim that increases maximum stamina and movement speed for a time
